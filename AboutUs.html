           <p>A popular hangout place in Mumbai, Leopold's has been around since 1871 and is one of Mumbai's oldest Irani cafes. (Distinct from Parsis, Iranis are Zoroastrians who came to India much later, in the 19th century). More of a landmark than a restaurant, its claim to fame is that it's "getting better with age". Undoubtedly, it's true! Not only does Leopold feature prominently in the epic Shantaram, in which Gregory David Roberts recounts his checkered past in Mumbai, it also survived the 2008 terrorist attack. (Bullet holes still remain on the walls, as a reminder and tribute to those who lost their lives). Leopold;s is invariably packed with people reliving its legends over huge pitchers of beer (or beer towers, for the really thirsty!). The food is diverse (Indian, Chinese, and Continental), the servings are large, and there's a cozy upstairs area with DJ playing tunes into the night.</p>

              <p>Britannia & Co has been in business since 1923 and is perhaps Mumbai's most iconic Irani cafe -- and, one of the last of its kind remaining. It's the place to go to try Parsi cuisine, which curiously blends Persian and Gujarati influences. The restaurant is housed in a grand Renaissance-style building designed by Scottish architect George Wittet, who also designed the Gateway of India. It has a fitting, pervasively vintage, ambiance. Sadly, the delightfully eccentric owner passed away recently, aged in his 90s. However, his legacy lives on. Do order the famous berry pulao (with meat, paneer or vegetables).</p>
